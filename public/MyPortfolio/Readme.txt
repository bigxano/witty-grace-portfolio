Problem Statement
Problem: Lack of Digital Presence for Witty-Grace Leather Works

Introduction of the Problem:
Witty-Grace Leather Works previously lacked an organized digital platform for showcasing products, sharing the brand story, and engaging with customers. In today’s digital-first marketplace, the absence of an online presence limits business growth and customer reach, especially among tech-savvy consumers.

Significant Effect of the Problem:
Without a website, Witty-Grace Leather Works faced reduced visibility, limited customer engagement, and missed opportunities for online sales and brand building. The lack of structured communication channels further hindered business expansion.

Proposed Solution:
To address this, I utilized my Laravel development skills to:
- Build a secure and responsive web platform to showcase products, portfolio, and company information.
- Implement user authentication for admin management of products and content.
- Use Laravel Blade for templating and Eloquent ORM for data management.
- Ensure the UI is modern, mobile-friendly, and visually aligned with the brand.

This solution enhances the company’s online reach, increases accessibility to products, and builds trust in Witty-Grace Leather Works’ digital presence.
